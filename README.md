## Random File Sampler

I wrote this program with the goal of automating the random sampling of face images from databases, mostly to prevent bias in image selection. 

This program randomly samples file names from a folder, based on specified file extension (image extensions: 'png', 'jpg'; but also any other type: 'csv', 'txt', etc.).
The sampling is without replacement.

More updates soon...
