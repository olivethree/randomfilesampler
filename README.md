## Random File Sampler

I wrote this program with the goal of automating the random sampling of face images from databases, mostly to prevent bias in image selection. 

This program randomly samples (without replacement) files of any given extension from a folder. The sampled files are then copied to a new folder together with a .txt file listing the sampled file names.

Latest updates:
- Created Windows executable file to run program interactively via pop-up window.
- New function samplefiles_input() allows to run the program interactively in the terminal

Coming soon:
- option to set seed
- output log file with sampling timestamp
